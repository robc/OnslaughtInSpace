Onslaught in Space
==================

A minimalist arcade shooter experience - take charge of a crippled space fighter and blast your way to survival against the incoming enemy drones. Can you clear the 10 challenging levels?

Created by Rob Caporetto for Ludum Dare #26 (Minimalism) in April 2013. Within the theme of Minimalism, I wanted to try & create a smaller arcade style experience which relied on some very basic graphics & audio, combined with a simplistic goal. The challenge then is defined through ramping up the variables to insane amounts.

Controls
-----------
* Left & Right Arrows to turn your craft.
* Space to fire your cannons.

Building
--------
Built using Unity Pro 4.1.2. I've not used any Pro specific functionality, so you should be able to open it on a machine with Unity Basic/Free with the same version.

Open Assets/Scenes/MainScene in the Unity Editor & you should be good to go.
